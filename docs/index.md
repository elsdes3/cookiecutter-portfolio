`cookiecutter-portfolio` a templated project structure for creating a new datascience project using the [Python programming language](https://www.python.org/). It is a based on the highly flexible [`cookiecutter-data-science`](https://github.com/drivendata/cookiecutter-data-science) template for creating the necessary scaffolding to support a datascience analysis workflow.

Building on this solid base, `cookiecutter-portfolio` offers several additional features such as
- auto-configures Github Actions to perform [continuous integration for datascience analyses](https://predictablynoisy.com/automating-jb)
- supports programmatic execution of data-science analyses leveraging the [`papermill` Python library](https://papermill.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
- auto-embeds links to [cloud-computing environments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Jupyter#Industry_adoption), to share notebooks/projects, in `README.md` file of created project

among several others.
